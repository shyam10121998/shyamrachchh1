  ## Writing Clean and Simple Code:

  - Give variable, function, and class names that are meaningful and descriptive.
  - Create concise, well-defined functions that adhere to the "Single Responsibility Principle."
  - Keep your code free of extraneous complexity, repetition, and ambiguity.
  - Use nested, lengthy conditional statements and loops as little as possible.
  - Explain the logic and function of your code through comments and documentation.
  - Regularly rework code to reduce duplication and enhance readability.
 
## Testing Your Code:

  - Use unit testing to evaluate distinct parts or functionalities.
  - Run integration tests to ensure that various parts or functions perform as a unit.
  - Perform system testing to assess the entire application or system as a whole.
  - Incorporate user testing to make sure the system satisfies user expectations and requirements.
  - Automate and simplify your testing process using appropriate testing tools and frameworks.

## Using a Coding Standard:

   -  Choose or adopt a coding standard that suits your programming language.
   -  Configure tools like [linters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint), [code formatters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) , or code analyzers to automatically check and enforce your coding standard.
   -  Regularly review and update your coding standard as needed.
    
## Reviewing Your Code Regularly:

  - Conduct self-review by inspecting your own code before submitting it to others or deploying it to production.
  - Engage in peer review by reviewing the code of colleagues or teammates and providing constructive feedback and recommendations.
  - Utilize code review tools like [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/), GitLab, or Bitbucket to streamline and automate aspects of the review process.

# [Article 3: PHP Code Quality Tools to Check and Improve your Code](https://thevaluable.dev/code-quality-check-tools-php/)

## Code Quality:

  - Use PHP CodeSniffer to find coding standards breaches (https://sourceforge.net/projects/php-codesniffer.mirror).
  - To automatically correct some of the code standards problems, use PHPCBF.
  - Take note of elements like typical class and method lengths.
  - Save abstraction for certain cases only.

## Complexity and Bugs:

  - Examine the intricacy of the code using tools such as PHP Mess Detector.
  - Address problems like cyclomatic complexity that is too high.
  - To find mistakes and confirm that the code is accurate, use PHPStan for static analysis.
  - Set the strictness level in accordance with the demands of your project.

## Coding Formatting:

  - To preserve code uniformity, use a coding standard.
  - Use coding standards-compliant code formatting tools, such as PHP-CS-Fixer, to format your code automatically.
  - To guarantee consistency, format your code frequently.

## Unit Testing and Code Coverage:

  - Put your codebase's unit tests into practise.
  - For unit testing, use PHPUnit.
  - Calculate and examine the CRAP metric to spot dangerous and complicated code.
  - Check the code coverage of your tests to make sure it is adequate.
  - To evaluate the effectiveness of your tests, use code coverage reports.

## Metrics and maintainance:

  - Examine measures like coupling, cyclomatic complexity, and lines of code.
  - Use analytics to pinpoint areas that need reworking and improvement.
  - Run code analysis programmes on a regular basis to spot problems early.
  - For thorough quality assurance, combine code quality tools with a strong testing plan.
  - include these tools for code quality into your development process.

## Analysis and Management of Dependencies:

  - Analyse and successfully manage project dependencies.
  - Keep the interaction between afferent coupling and efferent coupling under check.
  - Identify and fix dependencies-related instability problems.

## Static and security analysis:

  - To find security flaws, use techniques for static code analysis.
  - When writing programming, address security concerns immediately.
  - Make sure the code is secure and that it doesn't have unexpected repercussions.

## Maintaining Continuously:

  - Include [code quality tools](https://www.codacy.com/signup-codacy?utm_term=code%20quality%20tools&utm_campaign=Quality+-+Use+Cases+Global&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=9882323101&hsa_cam=20519036842&hsa_grp=158738021688&hsa_ad=672459033111&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-327625427670&hsa_kw=code%20quality%20tools&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwr_CnBhA0EiwAci5siiYlo9RqMvaPDFUJE0R5Ao0QSjyvnE59_hY3qvUw84cZ4g5PZujEEBoC-HAQAvD_BwE) in your pipeline for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
  - Analyse code metrics often to find areas for development.
  - Make continual code maintenance a priority to avoid building up technical debt.

## Code Quality Instruments:

  - Investigate and employ code quality tools like linters, static analyzers, and Stepsize.
  - Automate your development workflow by integrating code quality tools.
  - Utilise these technologies to make code review procedures more efficient.


## comaparison:

  - Testing of a code repeatedly, quality of a code and maintainance of the code plays a really big role everytime in code quality as we have seen this in all      the articles. In every article this above points which I mentioned are almost similar.

## Evaluation:

  - Evaluating my work on a 4 point scale, I rate myself with exemplary work. I spent almost one fourth of my day for it as it was staring of the course and I wanted to start on a good knot. It felt really good working and honestly did a good hard work for this article. Happy and highly satisfied.
